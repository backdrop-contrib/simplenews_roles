Simplenews Roles 6.x-2.x, xxxx-xx-xx
------------------------------------
#600040 by joachim: don't allow users to subscribe to newletters their 
  role doesn't sync to.
by joachim: Removed implementation of hook_theme: no theme functions.
by joachim: Removed deletion of anon subs in sync: it breaks simpletest and not 
  really needed anyway.
#331080 by joachim: Fixed unsubscribed users being resubscribed when roles are 
  synchronized. This requires simplenews HEAD. Branching this module for 6--2.
